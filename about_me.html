            <p>
                I am a web developer with a passion for creating websites and web applications.<br>
                I have experience in front-end and back-end web development, and I am always looking to learn new technologies and improve my skills.<br>
                I enjoy working on projects that challenge me and allow me to be creative.<br>
                In my free time, I like to read, travel, and spend time with my family and friends.<br>
                Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project.<br>
